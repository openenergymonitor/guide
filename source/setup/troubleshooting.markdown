### {% linkable_title Feeds / Inputs not Updating %}

There are a number of things to check if inputs or feeds are not updating. The first is to check the status of emoncms services on the `Emoncms > Admin` page:

![emoncms_services.png](/images/setup/emoncms_services.png)

Services: `emonhub`, `emoncms_mqtt`, `feedwriter`, `redis-server` and `mosquitto` should all be '**Active** Running'.

Service status can also be checked via SSH command, e.g:

<pre class="code">sudo systemctl status emoncms_mqtt.service</pre>

Potential causes of services not running may be: 

- Incorrect configuration
- Incorrect installation
- Full /tmp partition
- Full /var/log partition
- Unclean power cycle / power-cut related SD card corruption 

`redis-server` is a dependency of `emoncms_mqtt` and `feedwriter`.<br>
`mosquitto` is a dependency of `emonhub` and `emoncms_mqtt`

**All services are running but there are still no inputs on the emoncms inputs page**<br>
This may be caused by incorrect emonhub configuration. Navigate to `Emoncms > Setup > Emonhub > View Log`. A valid log should look similar to the example log below. 

1\. If you do not see any `DEBUG    RFM2Pi     8 NEW FRAME : OK` lines, this suggests that the RaspberryPi is not receiving any data from the emonPi measurement board or RFM69Pi adapter board. Potential causes of missing 'NEW FRAME' lines:

- Issue with emonPi measurement board itself
- Issue with any wireless nodes sending data to the rfm69pi adapter on an emonBase
- Invalid radio settings on the emonBase such as frequency or network group

The emonPi and emonBase receiver radio module settings are set in emonhub.conf, see:<br> `Emoncms > Setup > Emonhub > Edit Config`. The default RFM2Pi emonhub interfacer on an unmodifed system should look like this: [emonhub.conf#L21](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub/blob/emon-pi/conf/emonpi.default.emonhub.conf#L21).

2\. If you don not see any lines that look like: `DEBUG    MQTT       Publishing: emon/emontx1/power1 623` but do see `NEW FRAME : OK` this suggests an issue with the MQTT interfacer. Default configuration should look like this [emonhub.conf#L38](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub/blob/emon-pi/conf/emonpi.default.emonhub.conf#L38).

**emonHub is not running**<br>
Check the result of `Emoncms > Setup > Emonhub > View Log`, make sure that the log level is set to ERROR in `Edit Config`. 

A potential causes of errors could be invalid emonhub.conf configuration: double check emonhub.conf and consider restoring from default config [emonhub.conf](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub/blob/emon-pi/conf/emonpi.default.emonhub.conf).

**Emoncms MQTT Service is not running**<br>
Check the emoncms logfile for any errors: `Emoncms > Setup > Admin > Emoncms log` or via SSH:

<pre class="code">tail /var/log/emoncms/emoncms.log</pre>

A potential cause could be an issue with required services such as mysql, redis or mosquitto. Try rebooting.

Make a note of any error's shown in the logs, create a post on our [community forums](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/) to ask for further assistance, make sure to include in your post any errors seen in the logs and the content of the 'Server Information' section on the Admin page (click on copy as markdown or copy to clipboard and paste the result in your post).

### {% linkable_title Disk space %}

Check available disk space in the data partition by looking at the table at the bottom of: **Emoncms > Setup > Admin**.

![emoncms_diskuse.png](/images/setup/emoncms_diskuse.png)

Make a note of any full partitions, create a post on our [community forums](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/) to ask for further assistance, make sure to include in your post the 'Server Information' section on the Admin page (click on copy as markdown or copy to clipboard and paste the result in your post).

### {% linkable_title Incorrect system time %}

It's important that the emonPi/emonBase has the correct time (The time should reflect the UTC time). The emonPi requires an active Internet connection at boot to obtain the time from a NTP server. If using an emonPi for a long period with no web connection it's recommended to [add a hardware Real-Time-Clock (RTC)](https://wiki.openenergymonitor.org/index.php/EmonPi#Adding_a_Real_Time_Clock_.28RTC.29).


To check the time on the emonPi LCD display, press LCD push-button until `uptime` page is displayed.

To check the time via SSH type: `$ date`

#### To Force NTP time update:

   - Check that the emonPi/emonBase has a connection to the internet
   - Try a reboot
   - If time is still incorrect, force a manual NTP update:
   - [Connect Via SSH](/technical/credentials/#ssh) and restart ntp:
   
<pre class="code">
sudo service ntp stop
sudo service ntp start
</pre>

   -  Check time by typing: `$ date`

#### Setting the Emoncms Timezone:

The emonPi/emonBase time shown via SSH is intended to be UTC time. Timezone's are taken into account seperately in Emoncms and via the internet browser. To set a user account timezone in emoncms; navigate to: `Emoncms > Setup > My Account > Timezone` and adjust as required.

### {% Vrms reporting as twice what it should be %}

For users in North America, please read through our ['Use in North America' setup guide](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/setup/north-america/). Software calibration is discussed [in step 3](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/setup/north-america/#3-software-calibration).

### {% linkable_title Emoncms Local Password Reset %}

If the password for the local Emoncms account has been forgotten this can be reset by [connecting in via ssh](/technical/credentials/#ssh) then running:

<pre class="code">$ php /opt/emoncms/modules/usefulscripts/resetpassword.php</pre>

It then asks for the userid (default:1) and for a new password or option to auto generate. Example:

<pre class="code">
=======================================
EMONCMS PASSWORD RESET
=======================================
Select userid, or press enter for default:
Using default user 1
Enter new password, or press enter to auto generate:
Auto generated password: 9f7599c8da
</pre>

If the account username has also been forgotten this can be retrieved by connecting via ssh and looking at the MYSQL database entry :

When prompted enter the [emonPi default MYSQL root password.](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/credentials/#mysql)

<pre class="code">
$ mysql -u root -p emoncms
SELECT * FROM users;
exit
</pre>

---

### {% linkable_title Factory Reset %}

**Caution: this will delete ALL Emoncms data**

<pre class="code">
$ sudo su
$ /opt/openenergymonitor/EmonScripts/other/factoryreset
</pre>
