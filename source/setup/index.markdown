### [Next step: Connect &raquo;](/setup/connect/)

The OpenEnergyMonitor system  has the capability to monitor electrical energy use / generation, temperature and humidity.

This is an example to demo how users can edit the guide

The system is made up of five main units. These can be assembled and configured to work for a variety of [applications](/applications). The system is fully open-source, both hardware and software. All hardware is based on the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) platforms.

Documentation on everything from AC theory to sensor circuit design and application programming is available in the [Technical Resources](/technical/resources/) section.

### {% linkable_title Home Energy Hardware %}

> The OpenEnergyMonitor system can be used as a simple home energy monitoring system for analyzing real-time power use and daily energy consumption.


The hardware options to set up a home energy monitor are as follows:

***

#### **[emonPi](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/emonpi-3/)**

The emonPi is an all-in-one Raspberry Pi based energy monitoring unit making for a simple installation where Ethernet or WiFi is available at the meter location.

The emonPi can monitor two single-phase AC circuits using clip-on CT sensors. The emonPi can also monitor temperature, and interface directly with utility meters via an optical pulse sensor.

![emonPi](/images/hardwareimages/emonPi_shop_photo.jpg)

- Raspberry Pi-based energy monitor
- Install next to utility meter
- Local & remote data logging with [Emoncms](https://emoncms.org/), our open-source web-app for processing, logging and visualising energy and other environmental data, such as humidity and temperature
- Requires WiFi / Ethernet plus 2 x power outlets
- Requires [pre-built SD card image](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/wiki/emonSD-pre-built-SD-card-Download-&-Change-Log) (included)

#### Sensors required:

 - 1 X [Clip-on CT sensors](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/100a-max-clip-on-current-sensor-ct/) (the emonPi can accept up to two CT sensors; one is included as standard with the emonPi)
 - 1 x [AC-AC voltage sensor adapter](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/components/) (optional but highly recommended)

#### Power adapters required:

 - 1 x [USB 5V DC PSU](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/power-supplies/)

<br>

***

#### **[emonTx](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/emontx-v3-electricity-monitoring-transmitter-unit-433mhz/)** (optional)

The emonTx is a remote sensor node. Data is transmitted to an emonPi or an emonBase via a low power 433MHz radio.

The emonTx can monitor up to four single-phase AC circuits using clip-on CT sensors. A plug-in AC-AC adapter can be used to power the unit and provide an AC voltage sample for real-power calculations. Four AA batteries can be used to power the emonTx if AC power is not available.

![emonTxV3](/images/hardwareimages/emontxv3photo.jpg)

- Energy monitoring add-on node
- Optional add-on if more then two circuits need to be monitored or if WiFi / Ethernet connectivity is not available at the location of the utility meter
- RF Range is approximately similar to home WiFi and can be affected by obstacles e.g. thick stone walls
- Up to 2x emonTx can be connected to a single emonPi
- To connect an emonTx see: [Setup > Adding Energy Monitoring Node](/setup/emontx)

<p class='note'>
An emonTx can be powered by 3 x AA batteries; however, if possible, it is recommended to power the unit with an AC-AC adapter to provide an AC voltage reference for more accurate Real Power and VRMS calculations.

#### {% linkable_title Use in the USA%}

The emonPi and emonTx are designed to monitor single phase AC up to 100A. The system can work for some set-ups in the USA with some changes to the configuration. See user guide section [Use in North America](/setup/north-america/).

#### {% linkable_title Use with 3 phase%}

The emonPi / emonTx have been designed for single-phase AC monitoring. The emonTx can monitor 'approximate' 3 phase (assuming balanced phases) using [modified firmware](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/tree/master/emonTxV3/RFM/emonTxV3.4/emonTxV3_4_3Phase_Voltage) and 3x CT sensors + 1 x AC-AC adapter.
